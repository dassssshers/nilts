## Known issues

### Lint rule errors don't appear and quick fixes don't work in IDE (Fixed)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This issue is solved on nilts 0.18.3 using custom_lint 0.7.3.

Since custom_lint 0.6.7, the IDE has not shown lint rule errors in some cases.

See also:

- [analysis.setContextRoots failed - RequestErrorCode.PLUGIN_ERROR ProcessException: / No such file or directory / Command: flutter pub get 路 Issue #270 路 invertase/dart_custom_lint](https://github.com/invertase/dart_custom_lint/issues/270)
- [IntelliJ and Android Studio don't show custom lints 路 Issue #307 路 invertase/dart_custom_lint](https://github.com/invertase/dart_custom_lint/issues/307)

### Quick fix priorities (Fixed)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Finding which a plugin version fixed the issue is hard, but it looks work as expected.
> Checked works as expected on Dart plugin [242.24931](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6351-dart/versions/stable/644082) and [243.23654.44](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6351-dart/versions/stable/656656).

The priorities assigned to quick fixes are not currently visible in IntelliJ IDEA and Android Studio due to the lack of support for `PrioritizedSourceChange` in these environments.
In contrast, VS Code does support this feature, allowing quick fixes to be listed along with their respective priorities.

### fix-all assist (Fixed)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Finding which a plugin version fixed the issue is hard, but it looks as expected.
> Checked works as expected on Dart plugin [242.24931](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6351-dart/versions/stable/644082) and [243.23654.44](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6351-dart/versions/stable/656656).

The fix-all assist feature has been introduced in [custom_lint_builder 0.6.0](https://github.com/invertase/dart_custom_lint/pull/223).
However, this feature is not yet supported in IntelliJ IDEA and Android Studio, owing to their current lack of support for `PrioritizedSourceChange`.
